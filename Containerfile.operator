  # was called. For example, if we call make docker-build in a local env which has the Apple Silicon M1 SO
  # the docker BUILDPLATFORM arg will be linux/arm64 when for Apple x86 it will be linux/amd64. Therefore,
  # by leaving it empty we can ensure that the container and binary shipped on it will have the same platform.
